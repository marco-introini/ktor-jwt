# Kotlin Ktor JWT Example Project

This project is an example of a simple web application using Ktor, a framework for building asynchronous servers and
clients in connected systems, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.

## Overview

This web application serves as a prototype to demonstrate how to implement JWT authentication in a Ktor application with
Kotlin. JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. In the context of
authentication, these claims can include user data such as name, roles, etc.

## Technology Stack

* Kotlin: the language used to write this project.
* Ktor: provides the server for this project.
* JWT: used for secure transfer of information between parties as JSON objects.
